# Installation

If you don't have mysql installed go ahead, on mac just do `brew install mysql` I have used the default username of root and password empty but you use whatever you like, just update models/dbModel.go with your settings.

Once mysql is setup locally run `schemaSetup.sql` to create the db and tables.

Possibly depending on go setup you may need to run

```
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

Final step is run `go get`, `go install` and `go build` from the root of your application, then if all goes fine you visist the site at `http://localhost:8080`





For exmample usage please see curl commands in controller function headers
